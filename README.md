# Project-9
Initially a space-related page, now my portfolio! 'Project 9' has emerged as a pivotal achievement, despite eight previous projects where I made several attempts to create personal pages, portfolios, and CSS experiments. Unfortunately, all eight were lost. However, Project 9 will stand as a testament to continuous development and ongoing growth.
